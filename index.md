<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Biography</h2>

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) working in deep learning based speech enhancement and automatic speaker recognition. I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Najim Dehak](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/najim-dehak) and [Prof. Jesús Villalba](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/jesus-villalba). I am also affiliated with the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) and [Human Language Technology Center of Excellence](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/). Previously, I interned at [Tencent America](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/index.html) with [Dr. Shi-Xiong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4nGncN4AAAAJ&hl=en) at [Dr. Dong Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tMY31_gAAAAJ) speech group, [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) with [Dr. Antoine Deleforge](https://members.loria.fr/ADeleforge/) in [Dr. Remi Gribonval](https://people.irisa.fr/Remi.Gribonval/) PANAMA group, and [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) with [Prof. Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg). I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/ee/) in Electrical Engineering while working with [Prof. Tanaya Guha](https://www.tanayag.com/) and [Prof. Rajesh Hegde](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~rhegde/). I hold a minor in Artificial Intelligence from [Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/) from IIT Kanpur.

During my PhD, I worked on building speech enhancement solutions with focus on 1) state-of-the-art effectiveness (validated by real & noisy test sets from [NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation](https://sre.nist.gov/)), 2) speaker-identity preservation, and 3) transfer learning. I also worked on domain adaptation and bandwidth extension (super-resolution) problems for bridging the domain gap between (low-bandwidth) telephone and (high-fidelity) microphone audio. I also collaborated on problems like spoken language recognition, adversarial signals (attack & defense), and automatic speech recognition. In terms of techniques, we relied on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), self-supervised models, and perceptual losses.

I am interested to work more broadly in deep learning (self-supervised learning, multi-modal learning) and human language technology (speech processing, natural language processing) problems.

<!-- I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~schiele/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). As part of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) Ph.D. Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc), I was also co-supervised by [Dr. Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). From 2018 to 2019, I was a research intern at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and [Prof. Qianru Sun](https://qianrusun.com/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm).  -->

<!-- My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**. -->
